# Awesome Python Applications

Given Python's popularity, it should come as no surprise that there is
a lot of great Python software out there. But mostly it comprises
library code, to be shared among developers, a means to an end.

A lot of best practices for libraries don't really align with what
works for applications. This list features Python applications that
target an audience beyond developers, and share their code in a way
that other application developers can copy and learn from.

# Development tools

Tools deserve a category of their own, because while they may seem
like applications to us developers, they tend to share a few common
hallmarks:

* Used in software development
* Require developer understanding to install
* Often leverage many other tools in a customizable fashion

These characteristics make them less representative of the broader
software application landscape. But still, tools are valuable, and we
build a lot of them, so here's a list of mature tools written in
Python:

* Pentesting frameworks
* Arguably youtube-dl
* Static site generators
* etc.

# Notes

Applications are all about delivery. Many applications will feature
languages other than Python.
