# Awesome Python Applications

As developers, we spend our days with code. But it's applications that
matter to the wider public. When building our own applications,
open-source Python applications are a gold mine of practical patterns
that we know work together. <!-- the x-y problem, at scale? -->

This document is a list of open-source Python applications arrange by
topic. To see this list arranged by which operating systems they
support (and associated discussion), see Platforms, and to see the
list arranged by implementation approach used (and discussion
thereof), see Architectures.
